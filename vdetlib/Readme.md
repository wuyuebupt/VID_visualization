# vdetlib - Python library for object detection in videos

Original repo is at https://github.com/myfavouritekk/vdetlib. 

## Introduction

The `vdetlib` python library serves to detection objects in videos. It was originally developed for the [ImageNet VID](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2015/index#vid) challenge introduced in [ILSVRC2015](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2015/). It contains components such as **region proposal**, **still-image object detection**, **generic object tracking**, **spatial max-pooling** and **temporal convolution**.


The [T-CNN](https://github.com/myfavouritekk/T-CNN) framework contains many tools that utilizes `vdetlib`. Please checkout that repository if you are interested.

## Protocols
There are some basic protocol types for using this library. All of them are defined as python dictionaries and are saved as `JSON` files. The definitions are written in the [`protocol.py`](utils/protocol.py).
